   cd event-management-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

   cd event-management-dashboard-backend
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Create a MySQL database.
   - Update the `application.properties` file under `src/main/resources` with your database credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:5432/event_db
     spring.datasource.username=yourusername
     spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
     ```
